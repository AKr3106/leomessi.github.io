After adjusting to his new surroundings and settling in Paris, under new coach Christophe Galtier, Messi returned to his preferred free attacking role; being placed in his favoured position as the playmaker behind two strikers, in an attacking trident with Neymar and Kylian Mbappé, quickly regaining his form from his previous season by starting off the new season on 31 July by scoring PSG's first goal in a 4–0 victory over Nantes in the Trophée des Champions, winning his second trophy with PSG.<br>

Due to his form in the previous season, Messi was not nominated for the Ballon d'Or award for the first time since 2005.[344] On 21 August, Messi provided a long-range assist for Mbappé, clocked at eight seconds, for Ligue 1's second-fastest goal ever scored, before also scoring a goal in 7–1 away win over Lille.[345][346] The following matches, after registering six goal contributions, including one goal and five assists, Messi was named Ligue 1's Player of the Month in September.[347] On 5 October, he scored in a 1–1 draw away to Benfica in the Champions League, becoming the only player in the competition's history to score against 40 different Champions League opponents.[348] On 25 October, he scored twice in a 7–2 Champions League win at home to Maccabi Haifa, setting the record for the most goals scored from outside the 18-yard box than any other player in the competition, with 23 goals.[349] Four days later, Messi scored and provided an assist as PSG won 4–3 against Troyes to remain top of the Ligue 1 table. The goal was his seventh of the league season and his twelfth overall, surpassing his total output of the prior season in just 18 matches.<br>

On 26 February 2023, PSG defeated Marseille 3–0 in Le Classique, with Messi scoring his 700th senior career club goal as well as assisting two goals for Mbappé.[351] On 11 March, PSG defeated Brest 2–1, with Messi setting up a last-minute winner for Mbappé, registering his 300th career assist.[352] On 8 April, he scored and provided an assist in a 2–0 away win over Nice in Ligue 1, which allowed him to overtake Cristiano Ronaldo as the all–time highest goalscorer in European club football with 702 goals; during the match, he also achieved 1,000 career direct goal contributions at club level.<br>

On 2 May, Messi was suspended for two weeks and fined after taking an unauthorized trip to Saudi Arabia with his family as part of a promotional commercial agreement. He did not show up to training the previous day following a 3–1 defeat to Lorient. As part of his punishment, Messi would also not be included in squad training sessions during his suspension.[355] The next day, on 3 May, it was reported that Messi would leave PSG at the end of the season, following the expiry of his contract.<br>
